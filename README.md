### Level 3

Congratulations, it looks like you found the "bug".
Sometimes we like to blame others for introducing bugs in our code.

Think you can find out who introduced a bug into our file cool.cpp?

We think he had something to do with the development of git.

And from what we hear he also made a branch under his name.

Checkout to that branch after you find out who the culprit is.
